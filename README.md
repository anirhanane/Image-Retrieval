# Image-Retrieval
Implement an different Image Retrieval System ( Basic, image descriptors and similarity metrics using, pretrained model ) based on SmallHolidays dataset:
* Implement a basic image retrieval system
* Compute global evaluation on 500 queries
* Improving the image descriptors and similarity metrics
* Using a pre-trained model to extract features
